i will be dealing with the kinematic model of the arm 
using x, y and z co-ordinates. this modle will be calculated 
using a graphic representation of inverse kinematics. 

for verification and testing of this model, a simulation of the arm 
will be setup. this can be compared to the real arm model for verification.
